<p>Oh no. Don't smile. You'll kill me. I stop breathing when you smile. Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. 
    Conscious breathing is my anchor.Take a shower, wash off the day. Drink a glass of water. Make the room dark. 
    Lie down and close your eyes. Notice the silence. Notice your heart. Still beating. Still fighting. You made it, after all. 
    You made it, another day. And you can make it one more. You’re doing just fine.
